        <h1>Reflection of Two Methods of Website Creation</h1>
        
        <p>After using both HTML/CSS and wordpress to find which I found more preferable, I would say I enjoy the precision that HTML/CSS offers. While wordpress has convenient templates to choose from, needing to spend many minutes to simply <i>remove</i> content I did not want was not worth the effort.</p>
        
        <p>HTML/CSS allows for a clean slate, and while more work is needed to get a clean website, the amount of control afforded to users is much more preferable to me. Once I learned many basics of HTML/CSS, I already had countless tools to create a website that I envisioned.</p>
        
        <p>Wordpress does have its pros. The website looks much more professional than my HTML/CSS site. I don't have to spend time googling which tags create some of the results I want. However, the cons of being stuck in a template that may not configure to your vision and having to page through the customizations just to delete one element are major discouragers.</p>
        
        <p>I prefer to use HTML/CSS to design my websites- quality and precision over convenience.</p>
